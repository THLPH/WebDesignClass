Pokémon TCG Hub

Welcome to the Pokémon TCG Hub, a digital companion designed for players of the Pokémon Trading Card Game. This project provides a centralized, high-performance web interface for players to explore the game's structure, simulate board setups, and compare card statistics in a responsive environment.
🚀 Overview

The Pokémon TCG Hub is built to offer a tactile, digital experience that mimics physical card play. By prioritizing modern CSS techniques, the hub provides smooth, 3D interactions and a clear visual hierarchy that helps both new and veteran players manage their game flow.
✨ Key Features
1. Interactive Deck Table

The heart of the hub is the Deck Table, which uses a structured grid system to simulate the Active Pokémon and Bench zones.

    3D Card Flips: Interact with cards using CSS-only 3D transformations. Flip prize cards or face-down deck cards with a smooth, realistic motion.

    Tactile Feedback: Hover and focus states provide immediate visual feedback, scaling cards for better readability.

2. Strategic Game Lobby

A simulated environment for organizing matches.

    Matchmaking Grid: View available rooms and player statuses in a clean, flex-based layout.

    Safety & Fair Play System: A built-in, CSS-only notification system that ensures all players are aware of community guidelines and AI ethics regarding fair play.

3. Rules & Strategy Guide

A comprehensive resource for mastering the game.

    Model Comparison Cards: A specialized side-by-side comparison tool to evaluate the stat differences between Basic, Stage 1, and Stage 2 Pokémon.

4. Accessibility & Performance

    Zero JavaScript: All interactions, toggles, and animations are driven 100% by HTML and CSS, ensuring lightning-fast load times and security.

    Full Responsiveness: The hub adapts seamlessly from large desktop monitors to mobile devices.

    Inclusive Design: High-contrast focus rings and reduced-motion support make the hub accessible to all players.
